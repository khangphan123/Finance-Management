# My Personal Project <h1>
#Finance Tracking App<h2>

My project is a finance application that will work like an online banking system where users keep track of their money
and monthly expenses. This application functionality will be similar to some commercial online banking systems but with
customizable features that enhance users' experience like investing, trading stock, keeping track of the flow of
money. This app will be beneficial to many people, especially students who are lazy of
manually keeping track of their living expenses as it will help them manage money more efficiently. This project interests
me because I tend to make poor financial decision which leads to me exhaust all my money before the end of the month.
I believe that this app will make mine and many other people's lives a lot easier financially.
